Morocco is entering a new era of tourism growth, supported by ambitious national strategies and rising global interest in the country’s culture, nature, and hospitality. For SHBM students, this creates a unique environment: a living laboratory where theory meets real-world impact.

From luxury resorts in Marrakech to eco-lodges in the Atlas Mountains, Morocco is becoming a case study in sustainable hospitality development. Students at UM6P benefit from proximity to these emerging sectors, gaining access to internships, management exposure, and industry networks that shape future careers.
